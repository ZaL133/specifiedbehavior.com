                <h2>What is AI?</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of mimicking human intelligence. This can involve learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.</p>

                <h3>Different Types of AI</h3>
                <p>AI can be classified into two main types: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task (such as facial recognition or internet searches), and General AI, which can theoretically perform any intellectual task that a human being can.</p>

                <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI. With ML, computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: They learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. In general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised.</p>

                <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
                <p>Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. It uses neural networks with several layers (hence the "deep" in Deep Learning). These layers are responsible for the recognition and extraction of features from input data.</p>

                <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of AI that is modeled after the human brain and is designed to mimic the way that humans learn. It can adapt to changing input, so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.</p>

                <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
                <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to AI methods of communicating with intelligent systems using a natural language. AI can be used to interpret, recognize, and even generate human language in a valuable way.</p>

                <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
                <p>Computer Vision is the science of computers and software systems that can recognize and understand images and scenes. Computer Vision is the basis for a lot of the advances in AI, especially when it comes to recognizing patterns and objects in images and videos.</p>
