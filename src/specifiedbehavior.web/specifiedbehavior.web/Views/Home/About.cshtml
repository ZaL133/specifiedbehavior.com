        <h2>Our Methods</h2>
        <p>
            At Specified Behavior, we are uniquely leveraging AI in the creation of our own content and website. One of our key tools is OpenAI's GPT-4, also known as "Bard", a state-of-the-art language model. From drafting content to generating code, Bard is an integral part of our creative process, helping us to streamline our work and generate new ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            But our exploration doesn't stop there. We are constantly comparing and contrasting the capabilities of different AI models. From Google's Bard, to Microsoft's Bing, we are committed to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each, and how they can be best utilized for different tasks.
